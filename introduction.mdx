## Overview

ATSystems empowers you to build and operate highly automated systems for purchasing, optimizing, and monetizing advertising traffic. Treat traffic as your raw material, advertising networks as external markets with quirky APIs and rules, and focus your value on algorithms, infrastructure, and rapid decision-making. You integrate with dozens of ad networks, normalize their chaotic APIs into a unified model, make data-driven decisions on bids, bundles, deactivations, and reallocations, and automate processes that others handle manually or by intuition.
