title: Core Concepts of ATSystems
description: Learn the foundational principles behind ATSystems' architecture for handling ad traffic as a commodity and automating decisions.
---

## Overview

ATSystems treats ad traffic as a raw material sourced from diverse ad networks, which act like fragmented markets with inconsistent APIs and rules. You integrate with dozens of these networks, normalize their chaotic data into a unified model, and leverage algorithms for real-time decisions on bids, bundles, deactivations, and redistributions. This automation replaces manual processes or intuition-based approaches, enabling scalable optimization and monetization.

## Key Concepts

Visualize the four pillars of ATSystems architecture using these feature cards.

    Ad traffic flows in from multiple sources. You process it like commodities—volume, quality, and cost determine value.

    Each network has unique APIs, rules, and pricing. ATSystems handles this fragmentation seamlessly.

## Traffic as Raw Material and Ad Networks as Markets

You source traffic from networks like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and programmatic exchanges. Each acts as a market with varying supply curves, latency, and compliance rules.

    A[Ad Networks] --> B[Traffic Inflow]

    D --> E[Revenue Outflow]
```

This model ensures you treat traffic objectively, prioritizing high-value streams.

## API Normalization and Unified Data Model

Normalize APIs from 20+ networks into one schema. For example, map varying response formats to a common `{bidRequest}` object.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Raw response from Network A
  const rawA = { id: "123", price: 0.05, fillRate: 0.85 };

  // Normalized model
  const normalized = {
    requestId: rawA.id,
    cpm: rawA.price * 1000,
    fillRate: rawA.fillRate,
    network: "NetworkA"
  };

  console.log(normalized); // { requestId: "123", cpm: 50, fillRate: 0.85, network: "NetworkA" }
  ```

  ```python
  # Raw response from Network B
  raw_b = {"campaign": "abc", "ecpm": 0.045, "completion": 0.92}

  # Normalized model
  normalized = {
      "request_id": raw_b["campaign"],
      "cpm": raw_b["ecpm"] * 1000,
      "fill_rate": raw_b["completion"],
      "network": "NetworkB"
  }

  print(normalized)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use TypeScript interfaces for strict typing in production:
  ```typescript
  interface UnifiedBid {
    requestId: string;
    cpm: number;
    fillRate: number;
    network: string;
  }
  ```
</Callout>

## Data-Driven Decision Algorithms

Implement algorithms for bids and redistributions. Here's a simple bid optimization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch Metrics" icon="database">
    Query unified data model for recent performance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Calculate Optimal Bid" icon="calculator">
    Use formula: `optimalBid = baseCPM * (1 + qualityScore * 0.2)`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Decision" icon="zap">
    Submit to networks via normalized API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor and Adjust" icon="trending-up">
    Feedback loop updates models in real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Example in action:

```javascript
function calculateBid(baseCPM, qualityScore) {
  return baseCPM * (1 + qualityScore * 0.2);
}

// Usage
const optimal = calculateBid(45, 0.9); // Returns 63
console.log(`Bid: ${optimal}`); // Bid: 63
```

## Automation vs. Manual Processes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Approach" icon="user">
    Rely on spreadsheets and gut feel. Slow, error-prone, scales poorly for high-volume traffic.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ATSystems Automation" icon="settings">
    Algorithms process millions of impressions per second. Decisions based on data, not intuition.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Expandable title="Advanced: Custom Algorithm Integration" default-open="false">
  Extend with your ML models:

  ```javascript
  async function customDecision(trafficData) {
    const modelResponse = await fetch('https://api.example.com/ml-predict', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(trafficData)
    });
    return await modelResponse.json();
  }
  ```
